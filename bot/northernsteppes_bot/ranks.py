"""Rank and class-ladder rules for Northern Steppes members.

The only implementation of these rules. The site used to carry a second copy
as Tera macros, with a parity test to catch the two drifting apart; the site
now asks this code through the API instead, so there is one set of rules and
nothing to keep in agreement.

The rules themselves are written down in ``content/proficiencies/``, which is
what this is a port of.

Every function here is pure: it takes a MemberSheet and returns a value. No
database, no network, no Discord.
