"""A small read-only HTTP API, so the website can show current member status.

The site is static and only as fresh as its last build. This lets a page
correct itself in the browser: the committed content renders as it always
did -- indexed, and working with scripting disabled -- and a fetch updates the
parts that go stale, chiefly dues.

Deliberately narrow:

* **Read only.** No route changes anything. Writes stay in Discord, behind the
  leadership role.
* **No authentication, and therefore no secrets.** Everything served here is
  already published on the website: names, ranks, dues status and proficiency
  levels all appear on the member pages today.
* **`discord_user_id` is never exposed.** It exists only because of the bot,
  it is not the website's business, and it would let anyone map a Discord
  account to a member.

Runs on `PORT` when set. Railway sets it for a service with a public domain;
with no port the bot stays a private worker as before.
