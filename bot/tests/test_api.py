"""Tests for the read-only API.

Two things get the most attention. First, that nothing private leaks: the API
is unauthenticated, so anything it returns is public, and `discord_user_id` in
particular must never appear. Second, that it stays read-only -- no route may
change anything.

Uses aiohttp's test client, so requests go through the real routing and
middleware rather than calling handlers directly.
