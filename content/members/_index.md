Anyone may participate in practices, but for those interested in supporting the Northern Steppes, membership is a nonrefundable $30 seasonal fee. If an individual is unable to pay the $30, a reasonable rate of volunteering as first deemed appropriate by the executive body may be accepted. Please speak with leadership about this.

[Pay your dues and become a member of the Northern Steppes here!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaMLY65Y4IbSBpTQhiMNf6ssDzTFnUz7Z3VwNwsRR95fzbeA/viewform)
