{{ practice() }}

Practices are held on two different days and at two different locations to accommodate different schedules. Typically, Sunday practices have a larger attendance - averaging 30 people during the peak of the season. Battles are more structured here, and we generally run a couple different scenario/objective battles, sometimes using rope to mark out different battlefield layouts or obstacles.

Friday practices are more causal, but can be a good opportunity to get to know other members, or work on a particular setup when sparring.
