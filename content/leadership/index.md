## Chieftain

**Sir Kaigar Vegulfr Grimgarixsonr McBadass, Twice Belted**

The Cheiftain leads his War Band into the battle. Brave and true you can always spot the Chieftain at the fore of the charge. Both on and off the field the Chieftain takes care of his War Band and leads with honor. In the Northern Steppes we elect our Chieftain amongst our Blooded Members. They must be the best that we have to offer, not just on the field, but off the field as well.

The Chieftain fulfills the charter requirements as Administrator. In the case that no other leaders are available or elected to fulfill a responsibility, they fall to the Chieftain.

As he is the Second-in-Command a Hand of the Chieftain must be of the same caliber and quality of the Chieftain so that he can take his place. The Hand of the Chieftain is also voted on by the blooded members and therefore represents the Northern Steppes in all he does.
