The Northern Steppes is Northeast Indiana's [Belegarth](https://www.belegarth.com/) chapter based out of Fort Wayne, Indiana. Originally founded as a Dagorhir chapter in 2004, the group voted to transition to Belegarth in June 2021. Many of our members participate in other rope-playing games ranging from lighter LARPs similar to D&D, all the way to full-armor [SCA](https://www.sca.org/). We are a tight-knit family focused on fighting, feasting, and family.

We post all our news and events to our Facebook group and Discord, so join one (or both!) below to stay up-to-date with what's happening!
