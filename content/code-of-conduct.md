Informed consent is required for any activity, by any individual. You can withdraw consent at any moment you feel uncomfortable. Just because you consent one time does not mean you consent to any future act. When intoxicated, an individual cannot legally consent; an individual who is unconscious cannot consent and all consent given before becoming unconscious is revoked. 

## Reporting Harassment

Anyone can report harassment at any time. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a Northern Steppes Official immediately so that the matter can be handled in an expeditious manner.

## Reporting Safety Concerns and/or Medical Emergencies

If you are having or witness a safety concern or medical emergency, seek out a Northern Steppes Official immediately. Try not to leave someone with an emergency alone; if possible, instruct someone close by to get help. This may include, but is not limited to calling 911, getting event staff, or just yelling for help. All calls to 911 must be reported to the Northern Steppes Officials as quickly as possible after making the call.  (Event staff and site staff need to know when and why Emergency Responders are showing up at events.)

## Procedure for Handling of Reported Issues

Northern Steppes Officials are dedicated to creating a fair and expedient means of dealing with any and all instances that are brought to our attention. All attendees/members will be given an opportunity to give their version of events before any action is taken by Northern Steppes Officials.

After all the information regarding an incident is collected, Northern Steppes Officials will decide on disciplinary action if such action is deemed necessary. Northern Steppes Officials will decide on the appropriate course to take depending on the situation.

## Penalties

* Explanations and/or warnings
* Mediation between involved parties
* Moving individual(s) or groups to a different location
* Removal from the current event/function without reimbursement

This policy is meant to provide added protection for our members and event attendees. Nothing in this policy should ever be interpreted to deter any participant from seeking legal advice or making a report to the local authorities if they deem it necessary.
