## Process

1. Speak to Leadership about training to pass desired proficiency, or to learn more about the RP/Non-Com Classes. They will go over the requirements for what you are interested in and either practice with you or point you in the direction of someone to train with.
2. Return to Leadership with the approval of the Warden/Seneschal, and request to test for the desired proficiency.
3. You will fight 1 on 1 with a designated fighter of the required skill level. You will be observed by Leadership, who will make sure you are competent and safe with the weapon style.
4. You will then continue with the rest of the trials with the weapon style you are testing for, per the standards and requirements listed in this document.
5. If you pass the tests, you will be awarded the appropriate accolade at the following month’s KGC. For the base level styles, you will be able to test as many ranks in one gathering as you want. For the advanced styles, you will only be able to test for one rank per gathering. If you have not passed the test, you will not be able to retest until the next gathering (Unless at an event when if available you may test every day of the event). You may test as many different styles in a gathering as we are able to provide appropriate
challenges.
