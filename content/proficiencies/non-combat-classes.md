# Non-Combat Professions

A note on “Professions.” These are a fluid list and will go as far as you're willing to take them, you get out of it what you put in. They were designed to be a stepping stone to guide folks to finding hobbies within the sport they may enjoy doing, or always wanted to try but never could. You can have as many professions as you wish, as multiple of these may overlap with each other, and can hold multiple mastery titles as you wish. If we are missing anything, please talk with us and we’ll gladly see about implementing it.
