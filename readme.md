# The Northern Steppes

## Overview

The site is generated via [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/), a static-site-generator. All the content here gets converted into HTML/CSS/JS when a change is made, and is hosted on Github Pages. 

## Website Content

Everything in the `content/` directory is responsible for creating the content on the website. Pages can either be [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) files (e.g. `content/bylaws.md`) or a folder with a `index.md` file inside (e.g. `content/proficiencies/`). Zola requires that all Markdown files have a header that's surrounded with `+++` - check out the files for examples.
